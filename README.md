# melonDS Android

Android port of the DS emulator, melonDS.

This is just the core library with the appropriate changes required to make melonDS build for Android. An example of a
working frontend can be found in the [melonDS Android](https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android) repository.

DS emulator, sorta

The goal is to do things right and fast, akin to blargSNES (but hopefully better). But also to, you know, have a fun challenge :)

## How to use

Firmware boot (not direct boot) requires a BIOS/firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite.
DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.

### Possible firmware sizes

 * 128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)
 * 256KB: regular DS firmware
 * 512KB: iQue DS firmware

DS BIOS dumps from a DSi or 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps (in DSi mode) are not compatible. Or maybe they are. I don't know.

As for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!

## How to build
See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## TODO LIST

 * better DSi emulation
 * better OpenGL rendering
 * netplay
 * the impossible quest of pixel-perfect 3D graphics
 * support for rendering screens to separate windows
 * emulating some fancy addons
 * other non-core shit (debugger, graphics viewers, etc)

### TODO LIST FOR LATER (low priority)

 * big-endian compatibility (Wii, etc)
 * LCD refresh time (used by some games for blending effects)
 * any feature you can eventually ask for that isn't outright stupid

## Credits

 * Martin for GBAtek, a good piece of documentation
 * Cydrak for the extra 3D GPU research
 * limittox for the icon
 * All of you comrades who have been testing melonDS, reporting issues, suggesting shit, etc
